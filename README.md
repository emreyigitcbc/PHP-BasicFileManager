# PHP Basic File Manager

This is a file manager system written with PHP and JS. It has no CSS, if you want you can create pull request but I don't want to add CSS.

## Usage
When you download it, you have to change one line in `lib/Settings.php`,
edit `define("FM_ROOT", "YOUR_URL_/");` line.

Using is very simple, you can edit-create-remove-rename files. It has 1 known issue, that is "renaming". Renaming is not working properly.

## Contributing
I am almost contributing this project. If you create pull request I will see.
